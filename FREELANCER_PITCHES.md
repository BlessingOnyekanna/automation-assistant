## 🎤 ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds spoken)

"I help businesses automate their data collection. Instead of spending hours manually copying information from websites or APIs, I build Python tools that do it automatically. For example, I recently built a system that tracks competitor prices every hour and updates a Google Sheet - what used to take 2 hours daily now runs in the background. I work with e-commerce, real estate, finance, and marketing teams who need fresh data without the manual work."

---

## 💡 FAQ RESPONSES (Copy-Paste Answers)

### "What APIs do you work with?"
I work with any REST or GraphQL API - both public and private. Common ones include NewsAPI, CoinGecko, OpenWeatherMap, Twitter, Google Sheets, Facebook, LinkedIn, and custom company APIs. If you have API documentation or a data source, I can integrate it.

### "Can you schedule it to run automatically?"
Yes! I can set up your automation to run on any schedule - every hour, daily, weekly, etc. I typically use Python's schedule library for simple tasks or cloud solutions (AWS Lambda, Heroku) for 24/7 operations.

### "What if the automation breaks?"
All my scripts include error handling and can send email alerts if something fails. I also provide 30 days of free bug fixes and support after delivery. For ongoing projects, I offer monthly maintenance packages.

### "Do you provide documentation?"
Yes, every project includes a detailed README with setup instructions, a video walkthrough, and code comments explaining what each section does. I make it easy for your team to run and modify the automation.

### "How long does it take?"
Simple automations (1 API, basic logic): 1-2 days  
Medium projects (multiple sources, data processing): 3-5 days  
Complex systems (databases, dashboards, multiple integrations): 1-2 weeks

I always provide a timeline before starting.
